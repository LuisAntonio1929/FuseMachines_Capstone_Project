# Neural Operator in Tangent Space for the Exponential Representation of Kinematics in Manipulator Robots

In the realm of kinematics and motion modeling, certain mathematic tools such as homogeneous transformation matrices (1) and dual quaternions (2), are used to model rigid bodies.

$$
\begin{equation}
T = \begin{bmatrix}
R_{11} & R_{12} & R_{13} & T_x \\
R_{21} & R_{22} & R_{23} & T_y \\
R_{31} & R_{32} & R_{33} & T_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
