# Neural Operator in Tangent Space for the Exponential Representation of Kinematics in Manipulator Robots

In the realm of kinematics and motion modeling, certain mathematic tools are used to model rigid bodies.
To beging with, the Homogeneous Transformation Matrix (HTM), as shown in the equation below, is a $4\times4$ matrix composed by a rotational matrix $R$ and a translational vector $T$.

$$
\begin{equation}
HTM = \begin{bmatrix}
R_{1,1} & R_{1,2} & R_{1,3} & T_x \\
R_{2,1} & R_{2,2} & R_{2,3} & T_y \\
R_{3,1} & R_{3,2} & R_{3,3} & T_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

A second state-of-the-art tool are the Dual Quaternions, as shown in the equation below, which describe the position and orientation of a body using just 8 elements.

$$
\begin{equation}
DQ = q_r+ix_r+jy_r+kz_r+(q_d+ix_d+jy_d+kz_d)\epsilon
\end{equation}
$$

As can be seed, to describe a body in the space (position and attitude), the existented tools expend 16 elements in the case of HTMs, and 8 elements on the case of DQ. Nonetheless, for describing the position of an object is just requiered 3 elements (x,y,z coordinates), and for describing an orientation is also just requieres 3 elements (pitch, roll and yaw Euler angles). To sum up, it is requiered just 6 elements to describe an object in the space.   

The reason of this fact is due to the fact that these pathematic tools always are operated with between them to represent transformations between frames of references, as in the case of robotic kinematics. This is achived with the property of multiplication of matrices and quaternions, whilst the Euler Angles don't have an operation that represent this transformations. This is the reason why 3 elements for representing orientation is not enough, and these angles must be converted in other operable elements such as rotation matrices or quaternions. Nevertheless, there is an expresion that depicts rotations and just uses 3 elements, this is the axis-angle representation:

$$
\begin{equation}
\vec{r} = \vec{\mu}\theta
\end{equation}
$$

Where $\vec{\mu}$ is a unit vector, and \theta is the angle of rotation around the unit axis. However, this representation also lacks in operations to transform reference frames. For this reason, this representation is useless and must be transformed into HTM o DQ in order to operate.

On the other hand, the theory of Lie Algebra, and Riemann's Manifolds creates a relationship between the axis-angle representation with the HTM and DQ. It turns out that both HTM and DQ are the exponential map of the axis-angle notation.

- For Quaternions:

$$
\begin{equation}
e^{\vec{\mu}\theta}=cos(\theta)+\vec{\mu}sin(\theta)
\end{equation}
$$

- For Rotation Matrices:

$$
\begin{equation}
e^{skew(\vec{\mu}\theta)}=\begin{bmatrix}
R_{1,1} & R_{1,2} & R_{1,3} \\
R_{2,1} & R_{2,2} & R_{2,3} \\
R_{3,1} & R_{3,2} & R_{3,3} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

Where the skew matrix of the 3D vector is:

$$
\begin{equation}
skew(\vec{\mu}\theta)=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -z & y \\
z & 0 & x \\
-y & -x & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

- For Dual Quaternions:

$$
\begin{equation}
e^{\vec{\mu}\theta+\epsilon\vec{v}}=cos(\theta)+\vec{\mu}sin(\theta)+((cos(\theta)+\vec{\mu}sin(\theta))\times\vec{v})\epsilon
\end{equation}
$$

- For Homogeneous Transformation Matrices:

$$
\begin{equation}
e^{skew(\vec{r};\vec{v})}=\begin{bmatrix}
R & R\times\vec{v} \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

Where the skew matrix of the 6D vector is:

$$
\begin{equation}
skew(\vec{r};\vec{v})=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -z & y & v_x\\
z & 0 & x & v_y\\
-y & -x & 0 & v_z\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

It is important to notice that the exponential map is based on the Taylor Series:

$$
\begin{equation}
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \cdots
\end{equation}
$$

Now, given the exponential notation, this expresion can rise the following equallity:

$$
\begin{equation}
e^{X}e^{Y}=e^{Z}
\end{equation}
$$

Where:

$$
\begin{equation}
Z\neq X + Y
\end{equation}
$$

This is due the unconmutative property of multiplication in matrices and quaternions. Novertheless, there is an equation that finds this equallity which is known as the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula (BCH):

$$
\begin{equation}
Z = X + Y + \frac{1}{2}[X,Y] + \frac{1}{12}([X,[X,Y]]+[Y,[Y,X]]) - \frac{1}{24}[Y,[X,[X,Y]]] - \frac{1}{720}([Y,[Y,[Y,[Y,X]]]]+[X,[X,[X,[X,Y]]]]) + \cdots
\end{equation}
$$

Where $[]$ is the Lie bracket:

$$
\begin{equation}
[X,Y]=X\times Y-Y\times X
\end{equation}
$$

Now, the BCH formula is a low rate convergence series, and just converge if the following condition is met:

$$
\begin{equation}
|X|+|Y|<\frac{ln(2)}{2}
\end{equation}
$$

Due to these limitation, this project aims to create a neural operator $N$, which is able to perform the non-conmutative addition between the elements X and Y, as is stated in the following equallity:

$$
\begin{equation}
N(X,Y)= Z
\end{equation}
$$

To achieve this, the value of $Z$ is modeled as a linear combination of the first 6 elements of the BCH formula:

$$
\begin{equation}
Z = X\alpha_1 + Y\alpha_2 + \frac{1}{2}[X,Y]\alpha_3 + \frac{1}{12}([X,[X,Y]]+[Y,[Y,X]])\alpha_4 + \frac{1}{24}[Y,[X,[X,Y]]]\alpha_5 + \frac{1}{720}([Y,[Y,[Y,[Y,X]]]]+[X,[X,[X,[X,Y]]]])\alpha_6
\end{equation}
$$

Which can be written in matrix terms, where the rows of the matrix $M$ are the first 6 elements of the BCH formula:

$$
\begin{equation}
Z = M \begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_1 \\
\alpha_2 \\
\vdots \\
\alpha_6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

Then, using the Mooreâ€“Penrose inverse, the alpha coefficients are found.

$$
\begin{equation}
(MM^T)^{-1}M^TZ = \begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_1 \\
\alpha_2 \\
\vdots \\
\alpha_6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

The alpha coefficients are the pharameters the Neural Network ($N$) has to learn in order to operate the elements in the tangent space. As can be seen in the equation below, these coefficients are in function of just the rotational parts $\vec{\mu_1}\theta_1$ and $\vec{\mu_2}\theta_2$, given that as was ilustrated forelines, the translational part is just a multiplication of the exponential map of the rotational part with the translation vector.

$$
\begin{equation}
N(\vec{\mu_1}\theta_1,\vec{\mu_2}\theta_2)=[\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\alpha_4,\alpha_5,\alpha_6]
\end{equation}
$$

For a number of 100 000 random points in the tangent space, the first 3 coefficients are ilutrated in the following chart, where the color is to distinguish whether it is positive or negative.

In the same way, the other last 3 coefficients are ilustrated in the chart below, where the color indicates the dot product between the vectors $\vec{\mu_1}$ and $\vec{\mu_2}$.

![imagen](https://github.com/LuisAntonio1929/FuseMachines_Capstone_Project/assets/83978263/73fe7678-2858-4d94-86b9-872cdc0340e8)

As can be seen, there is a perfect differenciation of two clusters with the first 3 coefficients, which means that there will be 2 kinds of Neural Networks, one to predict the positive cluster, while the other to predict the negative cluster. This is because the topology shown in the diagram would be so difficult for a single Neural Network.

Continued, if it is ilustrated the relationship between the angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ in the x and y axes respectively, versus the dot product between the vectors $\vec{\mu_1}$ and $\vec{\mu_2}$. Then, the result is shown in the following ilustration.

![imagen](https://github.com/LuisAntonio1929/FuseMachines_Capstone_Project/assets/83978263/b1a949b1-7211-4dac-a53c-d0eeb11d995f)

As can be noticed, the scatter seems to be symetric with respect the origin. If it is taken the square of the angles and then it is colored whether the coefficient 3 is negative or not, it can be seen a perfect differentiation.

![imagen](https://github.com/LuisAntonio1929/FuseMachines_Capstone_Project/assets/83978263/c9ddc88a-f75c-4ba6-b533-c84d97a3e26d)

Therefore, the first Machine Learning method must be able to differentiate whether two vector in the tangent space lead to a positive coefficient or not. To accomplish this, it was used a Support Vector Machine method, whose input parameters where the two values of theta and the dot product of the two unit vectors. The Confusion Matrix of this model is displayed below.

![imagen](https://github.com/LuisAntonio1929/FuseMachines_Capstone_Project/assets/83978263/f7aa0177-f50d-41b8-9d26-fdf8daeb26be)

Once the model is able to differ the sign. Then the next step is to create two Neural Networks for each manifold in positive and negative side. For the positive manifold it was used a Multilayer Perceptron of layers [50,200,50,10,50,200,50], while for the negative manifold it was used a Multilayer Perceptron of layers [100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100].

The capability of the model to find the coefficients for the positive manifold are shown in the following chart.

![imagen](https://github.com/LuisAntonio1929/FuseMachines_Capstone_Project/assets/83978263/c54cbfb7-040a-4f62-900c-750b87973382)

The same for the negative manifold.

![imagen](https://github.com/LuisAntonio1929/FuseMachines_Capstone_Project/assets/83978263/dc51bc64-09f4-4626-a8e3-d8d03bc10521)

As can be seen, in all plots, the scatters are aligned with the diagonal of the frame.

On the other hand, to evaluate the capacity of the entire model to compute the operation in the tangent space:

$$
\begin{equation}
N(\theta_1,\theta_2,\vec{\mu_1})=\hat{Z}
\end{equation}
$$

It is ploted the cosine similatity of the predicted $\hat{Z}$ with the actual $Z$. Where it can be seen the score is high.

The same is done with the difference of the norm of the predicted $\hat{Z}$ with the actual $Z$. Where it can be seen the error tents to be near the zero value in the z axis.
